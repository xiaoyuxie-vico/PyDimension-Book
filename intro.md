## Toturials
**Tutorial 1** focuses on discovering scaling laws, while **Tutorial 2** covers the discovery of differential equations (ODEs/PDEs). For more information, please visit the tutorial that interests you.

## Identify knowledge in different levels

**Dimensionless learning** is designed to identify and extract scientific insights and patterns from data without being influenced by the scale or size of the input. This enables us to uncover universal scientific knowledge at three different levels:

- **Dimensionless number** at the feature level
- **Scaling law** at the algebraic equation level
- **Governing equation** at the differential equation level

## Code
