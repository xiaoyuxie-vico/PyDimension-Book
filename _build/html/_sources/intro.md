## Overview of Dimensionless Learning

Dimensionless learning combines fundamental physics principles with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to solve scientific and engineering problems. By embedding the principle of dimensional invariance into a two-level machine learning scheme, it can automatically discover dominant dimensionless numbers and governing laws (scaling laws and differential equations) from noisy and scarce measurements. This approach allows us to reduce high-dimensional parameter spaces and simplify complex processes, while still retaining a physically interpretable and accurate representation of the system. The detailed advantages are shown bwlow:

- **Dimension reduction**: 
  - Dimensionless leanring can reduce a large number of parameters to a few dominant dimensionless numbers.
- **Better interpretability**: 
  - The identified dimensionless can be interpreted as the ratio of different forces, velocities, or energies, etc.
  - Lower dimension also allow for qualitative and quantitative analysis of the systems of interest. 
- **Works well in small dataset**: 
  - By incorporating **fundamental physical knowledge** of dimensional invariance, the learning space is limited to a manageable size, which makes it possible to train well-performing models using scarce datasets.
- **Better generalization**:
  - Another benefit for embedding physical invariance is that the learned model have a better generalization in data with different materials and scales.
